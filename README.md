# Let's Go DIY


# Project Description

 Our project is to create an application for anyone who wants to learn DIY projects, find hotspots for art, and save their favorite art projects. The main feature of our application is to present "Project Ideas" and provide "Art Hotspots". The user can get project "how to" videos from different categories. There are 10 categories and in each category there are 6 project ideas videos. The videos provided are the most viewed from YouTube. There are also 4 categories in the Art Hotspots section and 6 hotspot locations that are the highest rated from Yelp in each category. In addition, the user can save their favorite projects to their favorites. The user's favorites is saved in local storage and it persists when the user clicks refresh. Our live page link can been seen in the <a href="#How-to-Use-this-Project-and-Acceptance-Criteria">How to Use this Project and Acceptance Criteria</a></li> Section. The user also has the option of removing a favorite from the favorites page. You can <a href=https://github.com/hannybear88/Project-1-Project-DIY/>Click here</a>  to see our code for this project.

# Motivation for Development
The motivation for our development is that all our team members like to do DIY projects. During our first meeting we all bonded by sharing our different art projects. We have all had experiences where we needed DIY project ideas, and want to know where to go get inspirations!! Thatâ€™s why we came up with this application to help you find DIY project ideas and search cool places for inspiration.

## Challenges
Some challenges we faced was when we tried to figure how to use the api for Pinterest, Reddit, and Devianart. It was a long process where we had to fill out applications and get approved. We got some help from Eyvette and Brian, however, we were unsuccessful in being able to easily use any of 3 apis mentioned above. We had applied to Pinterest twice since the first time we did not mention it was for educational purposes. So, the second time we applied we let them know that this is for educational purposes only. While we waited for a response, we had looked into Reddit and unfortunately, it had the same requirements for Pinterest. We had applied there to use the api too. While we were waiting for a response from Reddit, we looked for another alternative and we thought of DeviantArt. It took awhile to figure it out, however, it seemed like a long process just like Pinterest and Reddit. Unfortunately, we were denied access to Reddit and as well as Pinterest for the 2nd time. Due to that we had to shift our focus on the "Ideas" section and we chose Yelp and changed "Ideas" to "Hotspots". We ran into a CORS issue, but we had some help again from Eyvette and Brian that led us in the right direction on how to fix the issue. Another issue that was encountered was displaying the YouTube videos using HTML iframe tag. Evyette helped us solved that problem.



## Successes 
We created a fully functioning and deployed web application.  We were able to stay on the topic and just had to shift our focus which was okay because we were happy we didn't have to completely change our ideas and topic. Using the APIs that ended up choosing and successfully fetched information related to our topic. Everyone in the group was so easy going and willing to do their part and kept their word on doing their part. Everyone was helpful with each other with any questions they had. We all communicated really well.
